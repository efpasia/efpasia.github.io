Jekyll is a fantastic tool for building static websites. In this post, I'll share some tips and tricks for getting started.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll offers several advantages:
- **Simple**: No databases to manage, just plain text files
- **Fast**: Static sites load quickly
- **Free hosting**: GitHub Pages supports Jekyll out of the box
- **Flexible**: Use Markdown, HTML, or Liquid templates

## Basic Structure

A typical Jekyll site has these key components:
- `_config.yml` - Configuration file
- `_posts` - Blog posts in Markdown format
- `_layouts` - HTML templates
- `index.md` or `index.html` - Homepage

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in Markdown with YAML front matter at the top. This makes it easy to focus on content without worrying about HTML formatting.
