Welcome to my new website! This is the first post on my journey of sharing thoughts, ideas, and experiences.

## What to Expect

In this space, I plan to write about:
- Technology and programming
- Personal reflections
- Projects I'm working on
- And much more!

## Getting Started

I've built this site using Jekyll and hosted it on GitHub Pages. It's a simple but powerful combination that allows me to focus on writing content rather than managing infrastructure.

Stay tuned for more updates!
